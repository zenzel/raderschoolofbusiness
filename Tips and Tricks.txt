helpful tips:
-make sure in project->properties->c/c++ Build->settings the include paths are set to workspace "inc" folder, and make sure
	each header in "inc" is listed in the "include files"
-for some reason, to get a program to run, i have to run in debug, then let the program run from there. Maybe you have to do this too?
